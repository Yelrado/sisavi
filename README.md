# SisAvi - A webapp for News and Events
***
Have you lost an import Event at your school just because you never heard about it or because your colleges had not enough contacts? Yes me too. My college has a lot of departments and every of this areas has their own Facebook Page but I have not time to research everyday for News or Courses or Announcements.

That's why I develop this webapp. SisAvi helps you to be in touch with your colleges, teachers and every department in your School. Now, you can know how, when and where is happening something.
## How to Install it?
***
SisAvi works with [**Web2py**](www.web2py.com), so you need it first. Go and [download Web2py](http://web2py.com/init/default/download) (the normal version) for your operating system and run it, copy the link for the w2p file and paste in the Web2py admin section and that's it. It's Free Software, so it's good with you and your community.
