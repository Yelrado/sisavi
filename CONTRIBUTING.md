# How to help
***
We'd love your help. There are a lot things you can do to help us. One of them is translate this webapp to your language and the other is writting code.

As you should know this project is written in Python and Web2py. So, we use PEP8 and there are [some rules for Web2py](http://web2py.com/books/default/chapter/29/01/introduction#Elements-of-style) you might need to read.

We'd be happy with your help and we hope you can find joy helping us.
